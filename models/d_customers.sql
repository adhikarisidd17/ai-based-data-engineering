To update the `d_customers.sql` file, you would modify the SELECT statement to include the new column `date_of_birth`. The updated SQL would look like this:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  email,
  phone_number,
  date_of_birth
from
  customers
```

For the `d_customers.yml` file, you would add a new KPI definition for `date_of_birth` under the metrics section. Hereâ€™s how the updated YAML might look:

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: total_customers
    description: Total number of customers in the database
    calculation_method: count

  - name: average_age
    description: Average age of customers
    calculation_method: average

  - name: date_of_birth
    description: The date of birth of customers
    calculation_method: latest
```

Make sure to adjust the calculation method and description according to your specific requirements.
